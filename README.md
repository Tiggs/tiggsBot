A NodeJS IRC bot that implements [Node-IRC](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc). Contains several customized features for personal use.

2. Annoying Word Replacement - Randomly replaces nouns with key words and repeats it back at users
3. Moonkin Module - Based on the World of Warcraft addon [Tongues](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tongues), implements the Moonkin module replacing text with Moonkin speak.


## Todo:
1. Add multiple streamer support to monitor
2. Link saving: Store images and URLs posted to be able to recall later
